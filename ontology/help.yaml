  HELP.METER.BASIC:
    title: "Basic meters"
    short: "Fast metering pass for quick checks while you iterate."
    long: |
      Use basic meters when you want speed and broad technical coverage.
      It gives a practical signal on obvious level and consistency issues
      without running the heavier truth-focused analysis path.
    cues:
      - "If you want fast feedback while building a draft."
      - "If you are making many quick revisions and checking often."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Basic mode is quick, but less strict for translation decisions."
  HELP.METER.CORRELATION:
    title: "Stereo correlation"
    short: "Checks how similar left and right channels are over time."
    long: |
      Correlation helps flag mono-compatibility risks and unstable width.
      Strongly negative or unstable values can indicate phase cancellation
      that may collapse badly on mono playback.
    cues:
      - "If your mix sounds wide but collapses in mono."
      - "If center elements feel unstable on small speakers."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Very wide tricks can look exciting but reduce mono reliability."
  HELP.METER.LUFS:
    title: "LUFS loudness"
    short: "Measures perceived loudness so level decisions are consistent."
    long: |
      LUFS tracks perceived loudness more reliably than peak-only readings.
      It helps compare versions fairly and keeps your decisions grounded
      when balancing sections, references, and translation targets.
    cues:
      - "If two versions feel different even with similar peak levels."
      - "If balance changes after exporting or format conversion."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Chasing LUFS alone can flatten dynamics if over-prioritized."
  HELP.METER.TRUE_PEAK:
    title: "True peak"
    short: "Estimates inter-sample peaks that can clip after conversion."
    long: |
      True peak catches overs that sample peaks can miss, especially when
      material is encoded or played back through different reconstruction
      paths. It is a safety check for clean translation.
    cues:
      - "If exports distort even though sample peaks look safe."
      - "If you are preparing final deliverables for multiple platforms."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Limiter settings that pass sample peak can still miss true-peak overs."
  HELP.METER.TRUTH:
    title: "Truth meters"
    short: "Deeper metering pass for reliable translation and final checks."
    long: |
      Truth meters run a more rigorous analysis path than basic mode.
      Use this for confidence when finalizing decisions, validating renders,
      or checking critical translation constraints before delivery.
    cues:
      - "If you are validating near-final or final versions."
      - "If technical safety and translation confidence are top priority."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Truth mode is slower; use basic mode for rapid iteration loops."
  HELP.MODE.ASSIST:
    title: "Assist mode"
    short: "Conservative default mode with practical safeguards."
    long: |
      Assist is balanced for everyday workflow: useful suggestions with
      controlled automation. It aims to reduce obvious technical risks
      without pushing aggressive moves by default.
    cues:
      - "If you want safe momentum and consistent outcomes."
      - "If you are not sure which mode to start with."
    watch_out_for:
      - "It favors stability over dramatic tone shaping."
  HELP.MODE.FULL_SEND:
    title: "Full Send mode"
    short: "More permissive mode for bigger moves while honoring hard stops."
    long: |
      Full Send relaxes some eligibility limits so stronger processing can
      move forward automatically. Core safety barriers still apply, but
      this mode is intentionally less conservative than Assist.
    cues:
      - "If you want faster progress with bolder defaults."
      - "If you accept a higher review burden for stronger moves."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Bigger moves can overshoot intent; review outputs carefully."
  HELP.MODE.GUIDE:
    title: "Guide mode"
    short: "Recommendation-first mode with no auto-apply."
    long: |
      Guide keeps everything advisory so you can review each decision
      manually. It is useful when you want maximum control, training value,
      or client-facing traceability over every change.
    cues:
      - "If you want suggestions only and no automatic writes."
      - "If you are teaching, learning, or auditing decisions."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Progress can be slower because all actions stay manual."
  HELP.MODE.TURBO:
    title: "Turbo mode"
    short: "Fast, aggressive automation for draft momentum."
    long: |
      Turbo pushes broad auto-apply eligibility to accelerate drafts.
      It is optimized for speed and iteration, not subtlety, and can
      trigger stronger processing decisions than Assist or Full Send.
    cues:
      - "If you need a fast first pass to expose big problems."
      - "If turnaround speed matters more than conservative behavior."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Expect more extreme changes; review EXTREME flags closely."
  HELP.OUTPUT_FORMATS.LOSSLESS:
    title: "Lossless output formats"
    short: "Use WAV, FLAC, or WV for high-fidelity render/apply outputs."
    long: |
      Lossless output formats keep your audio data intact when MMO writes
      rendered or auto-applied files. Use WAV for broad compatibility, FLAC
      for smaller files with lossless compression, or WV when your workflow
      already uses WavPack.

      This setting affects export quality, not artistic decisions. Pick one
      format for handoff simplicity, or compare multiple formats only when
      your delivery requirements call for it.
    cues:
      - "If you need clean stems for mastering or collaboration handoff."
      - "If you want to avoid lossy artifacts while reviewing fixes."
    watch_out_for:
      - "More formats mean more files and longer render/apply runtime."
      - "Confirm your DAW and collaborators support the chosen format."
  HELP.PRESET.DRAFT_MIX:
    title: "Draft mix"
    short: "Quick drafting checks with truth meters for iteration speed."
    long: |
      Draft Mix is designed to keep you moving while still using robust
      meter coverage. It is useful when you want practical guidance early
      without fully committing to aggressive processing.
    cues:
      - "If you are shaping arrangement and balance in early passes."
      - "If you need frequent check-ins during creative iteration."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Draft-focused results still need final translation validation."
  HELP.PRESET.SAFE_CLEANUP:
    title: "Safe cleanup"
    short: "Technical cleanup pass for safer playback before creative tone moves."
    long: |
      Safe Cleanup is a prep pass. It clears obvious technical problems so your
      next creative decisions happen on stable ground.

      Think of it as tidying the room before the session starts. It can improve
      reliability, but it does not pick your taste for tone, groove, or emotion.
    cues:
      - "If your mix has clipping, loudness drift, or translation surprises."
      - "If you want to start from a clean baseline before sound-design moves."
      - "If you are prepping stems for collaboration or client review."
    watch_out_for:
      - "It does not add glue, punch, or width by itself."
      - "You still need artistic choices for vibe and arrangement."
  HELP.PRESET.TURBO_DRAFT:
    title: "Turbo draft"
    short: "Fast, bold draft pass when you need direction in minutes."
    long: |
      Turbo Draft trades subtlety for momentum. It is built to move a rough
      mix quickly so you can hear direction and make decisions faster.

      Use it for exploration, not final polish. It can reveal options and
      problems fast, but it cannot decide what fits the song emotionally.
    cues:
      - "If deadlines are tight and you need a fast first version."
      - "If you want to stress-test how far a mix can be pushed."
      - "If you prefer refining from a bold sketch instead of from zero."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Expect stronger moves and review EXTREME flags carefully."
      - "Always follow with a calmer pass before delivery."
      - "Speed does not guarantee good taste."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.BRIGHT_AIRY:
    title: "Bright airy"
    short: "Adds top-end lift and openness for a more breathable mix."
    long: |
      Bright Airy nudges the mix toward shimmer and space. It can help vocals,
      cymbals, and detail lines feel less boxed-in.

      Reach for it when a mix feels dull, but keep perspective. Extra air can
      sound exciting at first and still be too sharp on real-world playback.
    cues:
      - "If your top end feels veiled even after level balancing."
      - "If vocals need more breath and consonant clarity."
      - "If reverbs feel cloudy instead of open."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Too much lift can expose harshness and sibilance."
      - "It cannot fix poor source tone or arrangement masking on its own."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.DENSE_GLUE:
    title: "Dense glue"
    short: "Pushes cohesion and weight for a thicker, glued presentation."
    long: |
      Dense Glue pulls elements toward a shared center so the mix feels more
      connected and forceful. It suits tracks that need weight and unity.

      Use it when parts feel separate, not when detail is already crowded.
      Glue helps shape energy, but it will not rescue weak song choices.
    cues:
      - "If drums, bass, and instruments feel disconnected."
      - "If the chorus needs more forward body and impact."
      - "If the mix feels thin despite good level balance."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Can reduce micro-dynamics and blur transient detail."
      - "Watch for low-mid buildup and ear fatigue."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.LIVE_YOU_ARE_THERE:
    title: "Live, you-are-there"
    short: "For mixes that should feel like a real performance in a real space."
    long: |
      Live, you-are-there is about realism first. Keep transients, room tone,
      and natural movement so the listener feels the players in the room.

      Avoid reflex compression and limiting when the groove already breathes.
      Over-limiting can flatten depth, smear hits, and erase crowd or room cues.

      This preset favors restraint over polish-for-loudness. The goal is honest
      energy that still feels finished enough for practical listening checks.

      Translation still matters. Verify the mix on earbuds, phones, speakers,
      and mono fold-down so space survives without losing the song's center.
    cues:
      - "If the performance energy already feels right and you want to protect it."
      - "If room mics, ambience, or audience tone are key to the emotion."
      - "If the mix gets worse whenever you chase loudness."
      - "If you want conservative guidance before manual taste decisions."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Crowded low-mids can feel live in solo but muddy in context."
      - "Harsh upper mids can read as excitement at first and fatigue later."
      - "Too-wide stereo tricks can collapse when checked in mono."
      - "Do not skip translation checks just because dynamics feel natural."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.PUNCHY_TIGHT:
    title: "Punchy tight"
    short: "Focuses attack and low-end control for tighter groove impact."
    long: |
      Punchy Tight emphasizes attack shape and bass discipline. It helps kicks,
      snares, and rhythmic accents read with more confidence.

      This preset is for groove definition, not loudness tricks. It can make
      a mix feel cleaner and faster, but balance still decides musical feel.
    cues:
      - "If kick and snare attacks feel soft or smeared."
      - "If bass feels late, boomy, or unfocused."
      - "If rhythmic sections lose energy on small speakers."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Can feel sharp if transients are already aggressive."
      - "Do not chase punch so hard that tone becomes thin."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.TRANSLATION_SAFE:
    title: "Translation safe"
    short: "Balances tone choices for steadier playback across everyday systems."
    long: |
      Translation Safe favors decisions that survive many playback systems.
      It aims for dependable results on earbuds, cars, laptops, and phones.

      Choose it when reliability matters more than dramatic color. It can
      prevent obvious mistakes, but it cannot make every listener agree.
    cues:
      - "If your release must hold up on mixed consumer playback."
      - "If client feedback often mentions device-to-device inconsistency."
      - "If you want fewer surprises after export and upload."
    watch_out_for:
      - "It may feel less flashy than style-first presets."
      - "Safe translation is not the same as artistic character."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.VOCAL_FORWARD:
    title: "Vocal forward"
    short: "Brings lead vocal focus forward while keeping the band stable."
    long: |
      Vocal Forward gives the lead more presence and lyric readability. It is
      useful when the center feels masked by guitars, keys, or effects.

      Think of it as spotlight control, not a magic fix. If arrangement or
      performance fights the vocal, you may still need deeper edits.
    cues:
      - "If words disappear when the chorus gets dense."
      - "If vocal clarity falls on phone speakers and earbuds."
      - "If lead focus shifts too much between sections."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Can narrow perceived width if pushed too hard."
      - "Avoid over-brightening consonants just to force clarity."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.WARM_INTIMATE:
    title: "Warm intimate"
    short: "Leans toward closeness and body for a more human center."
    long: |
      Warm Intimate emphasizes proximity and midrange body. It can make vocals
      and leads feel physically closer and emotionally connected.

      Use it when a mix feels cold or detached. Warmth can support feeling,
      but too much can hide detail and reduce contrast.
    cues:
      - "If the mix feels distant even at healthy level."
      - "If upper mids feel brittle or unfriendly."
      - "If you want a softer, closer presentation for intimate songs."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Can darken sparkle and reduce perceived width."
      - "It will not fix muddy arrangement choices by itself."
  HELP.PRESET.VIBE.WIDE_CINEMATIC:
    title: "Wide cinematic"
    short: "Expands width and depth for a larger cinematic soundstage."
    long: |
      Wide Cinematic pushes depth and left-right spread while keeping the lead
      anchored. It can make arrangements feel taller and more immersive.

      Great width still needs a solid center. This preset can widen the frame,
      but it cannot replace strong arrangement contrast and focal choices.
    cues:
      - "If the mix feels narrow or front-heavy."
      - "If you want reverb and ambience to read with more depth."
      - "If choruses need a bigger stage without losing center focus."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Check mono fold-down and center punch after widening."
      - "Wide effects can feel huge soloed but weak in context."
  HELP.WORKFLOW.VARIANTS_RUN:
    title: "Variants run workflow"
    short: "Run multiple preset/config variants in one deterministic pass."
    long: |
      Variants run lets you execute multiple preset/config combinations in
      one command and collect each output set in a stable folder name.

      This is useful for GUI ingestion and side-by-side comparisons because
      every run writes a plan, result, report, and optional bundle artifacts
      with deterministic IDs and filenames.
    cues:
      - "If you want multiple reports/bundles from one stems directory."
      - "If you need repeatable variant folder names for tooling."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Multiple variants can increase runtime, especially with truth meters."
  HELP.WORKFLOW.RUN:
    title: "One-shot run workflow"
    short: "Run analyze/export/apply/render/bundle in one musician-friendly command."
    long: |
      Run workflow is the single-command path for moving from stems to final
      machine-readable artifacts. It always writes deterministic filenames in
      one output folder so you can hand off or re-open results without guesswork.

      Start with `mmo run` when you want one pass for analysis, optional exports,
      optional render/apply outputs, and an optional UI bundle. If you pass
      multiple presets/configs (or format sets), run auto-switches to variants
      mode so each outcome stays isolated in deterministic subfolders.
    cues:
      - "If you want one command to run the whole workflow end-to-end."
      - "If you need predictable output paths for tooling or handoff."
    watch_out_for:
      - "Rendering/applying lossless formats can increase runtime and disk use."
      - "Multiple presets/configs switch to variants output structure."
