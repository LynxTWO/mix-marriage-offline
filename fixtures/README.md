# Fixtures

Fixtures are deterministic inputs used for tests and CI.

## Folders

- `fixtures/sessions/` (planned): audio and session description fixtures for the full pipeline.
- `fixtures/policies/`: policy YAML fixtures (downmix packs, registry validation).

See `docs/05-fixtures-and-ci.md` for overall fixture philosophy.
